# aoede-dev
Development repository for Aoede Linux

Aoede Linux is an Arch Linux based audio engineering oriented distribution in the vein of the Ubuntu Studio, AV Linux, and KXStudio projects -- to name only a few of the inspirations for this project.

The bulk of the modifications to the Arch-provided releng scripts can be sussed out from the Arch Wiki entry on Professional Audio https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Professional_audio. The rest is of course the special sauce, which I have made obvious in the sources with #### COMMENTS!
