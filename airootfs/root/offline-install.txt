   Tango-inaccurate.png The factual accuracy of this article or section is
   disputed. Tango-inaccurate.png
   Reason: Instead of copying the files from the archiso, the "bootstrap"
   images available on the Arch mirrors can be extracted directly to the
   target disk. You will get a minimal system without the need to deal
   with the archiso modifications. (Discuss in Talk:Offline installation#)

   If you wish to install the Archiso (e.g. the official monthly release)
   as it is without an Internet connection, or, if you do not want to
   download the packages you want again:

   First, follow the Installation guide, skipping the Installation
   guide#Connect to the internet section, until the Installation
   guide#Install essential packages step.

Install the archiso to the new root

   Instead of installing the packages with pacstrap (which would try to
   download from the remote repositories), copy everything in the live
   environment to the new root:
# cp -ax / /mnt

   Note: The option (-x) excludes some special directories, as they should
   not be copied to the new root.

   Then, copy the kernel image to the new root, in order to keep the
   integrity of the new system:
# cp -vaT /run/archiso/bootmnt/arch/boot/$(uname -m)/vmlinuz /mnt/boot/vmlinuz-l
inux

   After that, generate a fstab as described in Installation guide#Fstab.

Chroot and configure the base system

   Next, chroot into your newly installed system:
# arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash

   Note: Before performing the other Installation guide#Configure the
   system steps (e.g. locale, keymap, etc.), it is necessary to get rid of
   the trace of the Live environment (in other words, the customization of
   archiso which does not fit a non-Live environment).

Restore the configuration of journald

   This customization of archiso will lead to storing the system journal
   in RAM, it means that the journal will not be available after reboot:
# sed -i 's/Storage=volatile/#Storage=auto/' /etc/systemd/journald.conf

Remove special udev rule

   This rule of udev starts the dhcpcd automatically if there are any
   wired network interfaces.
# rm /etc/udev/rules.d/81-dhcpcd.rules

Disable and remove the services created by archiso

   Some service files are created for the Live environment, please disable
   the services and remove the file as they are unnecessary for the new
   system:
# systemctl disable pacman-init.service choose-mirror.service
# rm -r /etc/systemd/system/{choose-mirror.service,pacman-init.service,etc-pacma
n.d-gnupg.mount,getty@tty1.service.d}
# rm /etc/systemd/scripts/choose-mirror

Remove special scripts of the Live environment

   There are some scripts installed in the live system by archiso scripts,
   which are unnecessary for the new system:
# rm /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/autologin.conf
# rm /root/{.automated_script.sh,.zlogin}
# rm /etc/mkinitcpio-archiso.conf
# rm -r /etc/initcpio

Importing archlinux keys

   In order to use the official repositories, we need to import the
   archlinux master keys (pacman/Package signing#Initializing the
   keyring). This step is usually done by pacstrap but can be achieved
   with
# pacman-key --init
# pacman-key --populate archlinux

   Note: Keyboard or mouse activity is needed to generate entropy and
   speed-up the first step.

Configure the system

   Now you can follow the skipped steps of the Installation
   guide#Configure the system section (setting a locale, timezone,
   hostname, etc.) and finish the installation by creating an initial
   ramdisk as described in Installation guide#Initramfs.
